# Becurious2019
# My Graph Activity at BeCurious2019, University of Leeds

This activity might inspire young children making them curious about the fascinating world of graphs. 
They could see how simple models can be used in everyday life and how ideas, that go back to Euler time, can help us 
thinking 'out of the box'.

 
**Activity aim:** Inspire children (age range 6-10) by Mathematical investigation of graph colouring, 
chromatic numbers, map coloring and Eulerian paths and circuits.
Explore with children some elementary ideas in graph theory, despite mathematically rich, yet accessible to children.
The resources I will be using are mainly booklets and coloured pencils. Web links:
